## Professional Demand Manager

Do you have a solid ERP setup and relatively good data quality—yet your working capital still feels bloated, and delivery reliability and lead times could be better?
Do your buyers have to jump between separate modules (e.g., Stock Management, Material Scheduling) just to complete routine purchasing analyses?

Welcome to Professional Demand Manager.

Professional Demand Manager supports procurement and production planning by automating monitoring and decision support on top of your CERM-ERP database.
It’s an AI agent that performs purchasing analysis automatically—not merely replicating your current process, but using Generative AI to provide optimization insights and actionable recommendations.

Buyers can quickly review (approve/deny) and execute recommendations, significantly reducing manual analysis.
The system demonstrates stock monitoring (ROP, min/max), material availability checks across all sites, and AI-generated replenishment proposals based on your live parameters.

AI Agent Assistance Includes



**- Source determination: Identify the most appropriate source for each order (supplier or intercompany).**

**- Stock monitoring: Notify users when material levels fall below minimums or when new reservations appear.**

**-Material optimization: Check widths and propose internal slitting from available stock before placing new orders. **

**-Stock policy recommendations: Suggest adjustments to minimum stock levels—including increases or cancellations.**

**-Non-moving stock alerts: Flag materials at risk of becoming non-moving.**

**-Forecast conversion: Translate customer forecasts into actionable material requirements.**

**-Production planning: Recommend batch sizes by factoring in production costs and annual volumes.**
