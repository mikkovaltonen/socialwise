## 1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

Valmet payment policy defines the global uniform guidelines for our supplier payment strategy and payment channels in all Valmet units. This document does not apply to trade between Valmet group companies.

### The high-level principles for this policy

#### Efficiency and accuracy
Valmet is committed to maintaining efficient processes and ensuring timely payments to suppliers. These objectives are best achieved by following the Valmet Procurement Policy and utilizing the recommended buying and payment channels.

#### Authorization and controls
All payments require four eye principal to ensure compliance with internal processes. Only invoices that have been properly approved in line with Valmet's approval grid will be paid. In addition, each invoice must receive the appropriate business approval before payment can be made.

Payment runs are executed only by users who are authorized to perform such tasks, ensuring that Segregation of Duties principles are maintained.

## 2. PRIMARY PAYMENT CHANNELS

### 2.1. Trade payments

Trade payment against a supplier invoice is the most common way of payment. Supplier invoices shall refer to the corresponding purchase order (PO) or spend plan for all purchase invoices conducted through the purchase order process.

Purchase orders can be created in two ways:
- Based on Material Requirement Planning (MRP) which is an end-to-end material planning engine inside the ERP
- Based on approved purchase requisition in ERP or Basware P2P

Formal PO approval that authorizes payment of an invoice can only be processed in the buying channels described in the Procurement policy. Approval processes that are not connected can only be considered informal/preliminary and additional approval for the resulting non-PO invoice is additionally needed.

It is important to record goods receipts on POs without delay when goods have arrived, or services have been performed and approved, to enable timely cost recognition and payment of invoices.

All supplier invoices that do not originate from a purchase order or approved spend plan must include the name of the responsible Valmet reference person, who is accountable for reviewing and coding the invoice. Such purchases are considered exceptions, as they always require manual processing by both finance and business users.

### 2.2. Non-trade payments

Non-trade payments pertain to parties such as agents, utility providers, auditors, and government agencies. Whenever possible, the same procedures used for trade payments should be followed. If payment cannot be made using the standard process, please refer to the exceptional payments section.

### 2.3. Payment cards

There are three types of corporate payment cards (also referred to as payment cards) currently available:

1. **Home billing card** (referred to as Payment card): The home billing card is a company liability card, but the payment responsibility is on the card holder.

2. **Company paid payment card** (referred to also as Travel card in some areas): This type of card is guaranteed and paid by the company.

3. **Company paid purchase card or procurement card** (referred to also as P-Card).

Payment cards are to be used for all business travel and other business-related expenses. Additionally, small or one-time non-purchase order purchases should be paid with a company payment card.

Payment card transactions for one-time purchases reduce the costly opening of new suppliers, especially in non-strategic supplier segments. Payment cards can be used for one-time purchases below 1000 € in value, or up to an amount preapproved in Spend Authorization. 

For more detailed information, please refer to Valmet Global Payment card policy and Valmet Procurement policy.

## 3. EXCEPTIONAL PAYMENT CHANNELS

### 3.1. Why are these channels not recommended

Exceptional payment channels create audit and compliance risks. Exceptional payment channels are prone to misuse or fraud due to a lack of standardization and weaker controls.

While exceptional channels are not recommended, there can be justification in special cases such as country specific requirements or pre-agreed contracts that require e.g. direct debits for recurring services. However, tight control and documentation of process and RACI are critical.

### 3.2. Exception: Site cash and petty cash

Site cash and petty cash are not allowed unless approved by Vice President, Treasury. If site cash is in use, requests must be made via manual payment request process. E-mail requests are not approved.

Site and petty cash should be replaced by applying for Valmet payment cards.

### 3.3. Exception: Manual Payments

Manual payments are considered non-trade payments as Valmet does not receive invoices to be processed. All manual payments must be approved by the defined official workflow prior to conducting the payment.

**Accepted reasons for manual payments are e.g.:**
- Taxes
- Urgent customs payments
- Sponsorships

### 3.4. Exception: Direct debits

A direct debit is a financial transaction in which a supplier withdraws funds directly from Valmet's bank account. Entering into direct debit agreements with suppliers is strongly discouraged due to the lack of control and visibility, which can result in reconciliation challenges and administrative inefficiencies.

In exceptional cases, a direct debit arrangement may be authorized only if the supplier is deemed critical to operations and no alternative payment method is available. Such arrangements must receive prior approval from operational finance.

## 4. PAYMENT FREQUENCY

### 4.1. Normal payment runs

Valmet aims to make payments on time. The standard Valmet payment frequency is once a week according to payment schedule guided by Valmet Treasury. All invoices that will fall due on the payment day itself or before the next payment run will be paid.

The prerequisite for an invoice to be included in a payment run is that:
1. It has been matched/approved within agreed timelines and processed to accounts payable
2. It falls due at the latest within the payment cycle, i.e. before the next payment run date

Payment run is a process where trade payments are sent to bank for approval. Suppliers receive payment from Valmet on the payment conduction date.

### 4.2. Exception: Rush payments

Rushed Payments outside the standard Valmet payment schedule should be avoided as rush payments carry additional costs and are not forecasted. Rushed payments are made only against purchase invoices that have been processed and accepted in Basware. All rush payment requests must be approved by workflow prior to executing the payment.

**Accepted reasons for rushed payments are e.g.:**
- Critical delivery of goods
- Discount for early payment

For critical infrastructure suppliers such as electricity, gas, phones, authorities etc. where the normal payment schedule cannot be utilized, Valmet will conduct payment runs outside the normal payment schedule and without rush payment approval process. Prerequisite for critical payments is invoice approval in Basware prior to the payment.

### 4.3. Exception: Advance payments

No advance payments, meaning any payments made prior to delivery or receipt of goods or services shall be allowed or promoted.

Country- or market-specific exceptions may be granted in alignment with local regulations and required approvals. In such cases, advance payments may be authorized by the Business Area Head of Procurement, provided the approval is within the individual's defined approval limits.

**Exceptions are projects**, where size, duration or other aspects necessitate payments before actual receipt of goods or services in ERP. This is also called the Vendor Payment Plan (VPP) concept.
- In such cases the globally agreed processes for such situations shall be followed to ensure control and compliance
- In such cases the payments are made by installments

If local guidelines require an advance payment to a supplier before an invoice is issued to Valmet, an advance payment request must be approved through auditable payment approval flow prior to making the payment.

### 4.4. Exception: Bank guarantees

Bank guarantees are required from a supplier when Valmet is required to make an advance payment to the supplier (all payments made prior to delivery) for suppliers who are not whitelisted as per Valmet internal processes.

For more detailed information, please refer to "Valmet Guidelines for Bank Guarantees Required from Suppliers" in Valmet intranet.

## 5. LATE INTERESTS AND NOTIFICATION COSTS

Late interests or notification fees shall be paid if resulting from Valmet failing to meet its obligations. If the difference between the agreed payment term and supplier stated payment term on an invoice (shorter payment term on invoice) causes late interest or notification costs, Valmet is not obliged to pay the costs in question.

For more detailed information regarding Valmet standard payment terms for suppliers, please refer to General purchase conditions.
